Thank you for taking the time for this. These projects I completed or in-process are intended for potential employers to view, assess skill level and generally make decisions on employment possbilities. These project are in MS Excel format. 
1) business_update.xlsx was a project I created from a internet download database. INSIGHTS: A) Sales volume over the 3 years followed a rather steep decline. B) The pandemic of 2020 had a huge negative influence on sales volume.  C) Accessories, bikes and clothing have consistantly outpreformed components.  RECOMMENDATIONS: Increase funding for Accessories, bikes and clothing while decrease funding for components. 
2) Corona Virus (Covid-19) Temp was a project I created from the WHO data center download on the COvid-19. INSIGHTS: A)From 2020 to 2023 reported infections and deaths followed an upward trend, both seeming to peak in 2023 B) The mortality rate in 2020 was approx. 2.4% while 2023 was apporx. .89%. This can be attrributed to a less virulent virus and increase in overall vaccination rate and prevenative measures being adopted.  C) Recommendations: Its important to note these were only reported cases, where the actual number is believed to be much higher. Increase funding for various world organizations addressing the COVID, greater pressure on under-reporting countries to update their reported data. More efforts worldwide for co-operation among countries for future prevenative measures. 
3) Chat.openAI.com This was a AI eperiment. This is only a temporary dashboard which will serve as a basis for a experiment in AI/Excel to produce a larger database with a longer time line. INSIGHTS: A) Mobile conversion rate of visits to purchase is considerably higher, 12.7% than the desktop B) Electronics category in dollar sales around $1200 more in volume than the next nearest ( home and garden ) category. RECOMMENDATIONS would be increase chanel funding for mobile and electronics, while keeping an eye on a possible cannabalizing effect. In other words, the net gain.  NOTE *This AI generated file was limited for only a 2 day period which in the real world would not give a actionable recommendation.
